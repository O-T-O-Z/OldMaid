Three experimental setups were run for 5000 games, and the loser was recorded for each game. Each experimental condition had a 'main' agent whose loss rate was calculated over the 5000 games. The results are as follows:

condition 0: basic logical agent plays against random agents
logical agent's loss rate: 0.31
loss histogram: (1550, 1811, 1639), where the first value is for the logical agent

condition 1: epistemic agent plays against random agents
epistemic agent's loss rate: 0.3132
loss histogram: (1566, 1841, 1593), where the first value is for the epistemic agent

condition 2: epistemic agent plays against basic logical agents
epistemic agent's loss rate: 0.3484
loss histogram: (1742, 1695, 1563), where the first value 

It appears that both the agents which use basic logical reasoning, and the agents which use both basic logic and epistemic reasoning are both able to slightly outperform the random agents. However, according to our observed results, it appears that adding epistemic knowledge to the agents does not impove performance.

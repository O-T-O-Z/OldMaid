## Introduction
The Old Maid is a card game that dates back to at least 1821[^1]. The goal of the game is to discard all the cards in one's hand by forming pairs of cards which can be discarded. However, there is one odd card, resulting from either removing a queen or jack of clubs or by adding a Joker card. The player that is left with the odd card at the end of the game is called the "old maid" and is the loser of the game. The game can be played with two or more players. 

## Rules

The rules of the game are as follows:
- A deck of cards is shuffled and either one queen/king/random card is removed or a Joker card is added.
- The deck is distributed evenly accross all players.
- A player must discard pairs of cards, matching the colors and the number/type of the card.
- A player cannot discard more than two matching cards.
- Discarded pairs must be displayed face-up in front of the player, visible to other players.
- Each turn, a player must draw a random card from the player on the left.
- The player left with the unmatchable card is the "old maid" and is the loser of the game.

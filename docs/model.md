## Goal
The goal of modeling the Old Maid card game is to find out the advantage of using higher-order knowledge over not applying this type of knowledge by comparing higher-order knowledge image with randomly playing agents.

## Simplifications
There are a couple of simplifications that have to be considered when modeling the Old Maid card game in the context of epistemic logic. To investigate whether the use of higher-order knowledge can be advantageous to not using this knowledge, we assume the following:
- Knowledge agents can keep track of the hands of the players in the game.
- Agents will not shuffle their hand and new cards will be added to the end of the hand.
- We will focus on 3 players and 3 types of cards first.

## Experiments
We will perform multiple experiments in which we play random agents with higher-order knowledge agents, as well as games in which exclusively random or higher-order knowledge agents are employed.

## Knowledge representation
